Overview
Before we go into detail about artificial neural network, we should try to imagine how biological neural network works.
A biological neural network is composed of a groups of chemically connected or functionally associated neurons.
A single neuron may be connected to many other neurons and the total number of neurons and connections in a network may be extensive. 
Connections, called synapses, are usually formed from axons to dendrites, though dendrodendritic synapses and other connections are possible.
Apart from the electrical signaling, there are other forms of signaling that arise from neurotransmitter diffusion.

A neural network is a network or circuit of biological neurons, or, in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes.
Thus, a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, used for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems.

[LECTURE]
The connections of the biological neuron are modeled in artificial neural networks as weights between nodes. 
A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. 
All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred to as a linear combination. 
Finally, an activation function controls the amplitude of the output.

Artificial intelligence, cognitive modeling, and neural networks are information processing paradigms inspired by the way biological neural systems process data. 
Artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling try to simulate some properties of biological neural networks. 
In the artificial intelligence field, artificial neural networks have been applied successfully to speech recognition, image analysis and adaptive control, 
in order to construct software agents (in computer and video games) or autonomous robots.
Neural network theory has served both to better identify how the neurons in the brain function and to provide the basis for efforts to create artificial intelligence.
